            Before the spread of flexible methodologies, the typical process of program development was copied from the processes of other areas, e.g., production or construction.
            The customer drew up a comprehensive technical task for the development team: hundreds and thousands of pages of text which described the final result in every single detail. The team set the deadline when everything would be ready, and started working.
            Disadvantages of the classical approach: Deadlines were disrupted. The longer the deadline was, the more difficult it was to comply with it. As a result, deadlines were often disrupted; thus, causing conflicts and harming business; The product turned out to be outdated. Over the years of development, the business landscape could change dramatically, and the final product would no longer be needed at the market; Editing was difficult. Due to the requirement to strictly formalize the reference terms, it was hard to introduce something new into it since even a minor edit had to undergo an entire approval process, which may take longer than the implementation itself.

          <aside class="notes">
            In 2001, “Manifest of flexible software development” was developed. These basic principles were described in the document: People and interaction are more important than processes and tools; A working product is more important than comprehensive documentation; Cooperation with the customer is more important than agreeing on contract terms and conditions; Willingness to change is more important than following the original plan.
            This marked the beginning of rapid development of flexible methodologies, with Scrum and Kanban being the most popular ones.

            Product owners are the champions for their product. They are focused on understanding business, customers, and market requirements; then prioritizing the work to be done by the engineering team accordingly. They focus on the business part and are responsible for the project ROI. They translate the vision of the project to the team, validate the benefits in stories to be incorporated into the Product Backlog, and prioritize them on a regular basis.
            Scrum masters are the champions for scrum within their teams. They coach teams, product owners, and the business on the scrum process, and at the same time constantly look for ways to fine-tune their practice.
            An effective scrum master deeply understands the work being done by the team, and can help the team optimize their transparency and delivery flow.
            The scrum development team is a group of professionals with all the necessary technical knowledge to develop the project. All team members cooperate with one another to ensure a successful sprint completion.
            A Scrum team is self-organized and typically small, with no more than nine people.

            Product Backlog is a list that incorporates everything the product needs to satisfy potential customers. It is the team's “To Do” list which is devised by the product owner, and the functions are prioritized according to their importance and value for the business. The product owner's goal is to answer the question: “What should be done?”.
            Sprint Backlog is the list of items, user's stories, or bug fixes, selected by the development team to be implemented in the current sprint cycle. 
            As a rule, the sprint backlog is displayed on physical boards called Scrum board, which makes the entire development process visible to everyone who enters the development area.
            Increment (or Sprint Goal) is a usable end-product from a sprint. It is the sum of all the tasks, use cases, user stories, product backlogs or any other element that was developed during the sprint and that will be made available to the end user in the form of Software.

              Events in Scrum: Organize the backlog; Sprint planning; Sprint; Daily scrum, or stand up; Sprint review; Sprint retrospective.
              Sprint review: At the end of the sprint, the team gets together for an informal session to view or inspect an increment demo. The development team showcases the backlog items that are now "Done" to stakeholders and teammates to get their feedback. The product owner can decide whether or not the increment can be released. 
              Sprint retrospective: at this stage, the team comes together to document and discuss what worked and what didn't during the current sprint, projects, people or relationships, tools, or even certain ceremonies. The idea is to create a safe place where the team can focus on what went well and what needs to be improved next time, but less on what went wrong.

            Organize the backlog: Sometimes known as backlog grooming, this event is a product owner's responsibility. The product owner's main jobs are to drive the product towards their product vision and continually monitor the market as well as the customer. Therefore, the product owner is to update this list taking into account users' and development team's feedback, thus helping them prioritize and keep the list clean and ready to be worked on at any given time.

            Sprint planning: typical for Agile frameworks, Scrum uses an iterative approach to completing projects. Instead of delivering a project all at once, teams complete and deliver tasks in stages, thus making makes it easier to adapt to changes and evolving priorities.
            The team breaks the workload into short timeframes called sprints. Each sprint lasts two weeks or one month. 
            The work to be performed (scope) during the current sprint is planned during this meeting by the entire development team. This meeting is led by the scrum master and is aimed at team decision over the sprint goal. 
            Sprint planning should take no more than two hours for each sprint week. Thus, such a meeting can last from 2 to 8 hours.
            In the first part of Sprint Planning, the Product Owner and the Team review the Product Backlog high-priority elements the Product Owner is interested in implementing in this Sprint, and define Sprint goals. The sprint goal determining process is also called grooming. 
            Each Product Backlog element that falls into the current sprint is divided into smaller tasks; then the work complexity is evaluated, and a sprint backlog is created as a result.
            Planning Poker / Scrum poker techniques and Wideband Delphi methodology are used to assess the work complexity. Story points are advised to be used to assess complexity or to indicate clothing sizes. 
            The most important thing a team can leave a sprint planning meeting with is a clear understanding of what needs to be achieved during the sprint and how to start moving towards this goal.

            Daily scrum, or stand up: This is a daily super-short meeting that happens at the same time (usually in the morning) and place to keep it simple. Many teams try to complete the meeting in 15 minutes, but that’s just a guideline. This meeting can also be referred to as a daily stand-up emphasizing its brief and energetic manner. The daily scrum goal is for everyone on the team to catch up, be on the same page, aligne with the sprint goal, and to get a plan for the next 24 hours.
            A common way to conduct a stand up is for every team member to answer three questions in the context of achieving the sprint goal: What did I do yesterday?; What am I planning to do today?; Are there any obstacles?
